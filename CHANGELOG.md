- Visual feedback for saved loops (green checkmark)
- Hover effects and context menus for enhanced UX

#### File Management
- Persistent storage in Documents/SavedLoops/
- Automatic duplicate name handling
- Orphaned file cleanup and library rebuilding
- Disk space validation before saving
- Export functionality with file save dialog

#### Error Handling
- Comprehensive LoopError enum with user-friendly messages
- Graceful degradation when files are missing
- Background file operations to prevent UI blocking
- Automatic recovery from corrupted metadata

### User Features

- âœ… SwiftUI best practices throughout

### Loop Preview Feature Implementation

#### Core Preview Engine (LoopPreviewEngine)
- âœ… Dedicated lightweight audio engine for preview functionality
- âœ… Separate from main audio engine to prevent interference
- âœ… Single-shot playback (no looping for previews)
- âœ… Volume control with dedicated preview volume setting
- âœ… Automatic cleanup and memory management
- âœ… Published state for reactive UI updates

#### UI Integration (LoopRowView)
- âœ… Preview button with play/pause icons based on state
- âœ… Hover-based visibility alongside existing action buttons
- âœ… Color-coded preview state (blue = ready, orange = playing)
- âœ… Contextual tooltips ("Preview loop" / "Stop preview")
- âœ… Context menu integration for preview actions

#### ViewModel Coordination (LoopLibraryViewModel)
- âœ… Preview engine integration with error handling
- âœ… Single-preview-at-a-time constraint enforcement
- âœ… State management for current preview tracking
- âœ… Volume control propagation to preview engine

#### Enhanced UX (LoopLibraryView)
- âœ… Preview volume control slider in library header
- âœ… Visual feedback for currently playing preview
- âœ… Seamless integration with existing library features
- âœ… Proper cleanup when library is closed

#### Technical Features
- âœ… Automatic preview stop on playback completion
- âœ… Non-blocking preview operations
- âœ… Proper audio engine lifecycle management
- âœ… Error handling with user-friendly messages
- âœ… Memory-efficient single-file loading
