## Audio Signal Path

### 1. Input Signal Chain

```
Physical Input Device (Microphone/Interface)
           ↓
    macOS Core Audio System
           ↓
    AVAudioEngine.inputNode
           ↓
    AVAudioMixerNode.mainMixerNode (for monitoring)
           ↓
    Audio Tap (for level monitoring & recording)
           ↓
    [Recording Path] → AVAudioFile → Disk Storage
    [Monitoring Path] → Level Calculation → UI Display
```

### 2. Playback Signal Chain

```
Recorded Audio File (WAV on disk)
           ↓
    AVAudioFile (loaded into memory)
           ↓
    AVAudioPlayerNode (with loop scheduling)
           ↓
    AVAudioEngine.mainMixerNode
           ↓
    macOS Core Audio System
           ↓
    Physical Output Device (Speakers/Headphones)
```

### 3. Signal Processing Flow

**Input Processing:**
1. **Audio Input**: Raw audio from input device flows into `AVAudioEngine.inputNode`
2. **Format Detection**: Input format is dynamically detected from `inputNode.outputFormat(forBus: 0)`
3. **Level Monitoring**: Real-time level calculation using RMS averaging of audio buffer samples
4. **Recording Tap**: When recording, audio buffers are written directly to `AVAudioFile` using native input format

**Output Processing:**
1. **File Loading**: Recorded WAV files are loaded into `AVAudioFile`
2. **Loop Scheduling**: `AVAudioPlayerNode` schedules file playback with completion handlers for seamless looping
3. **Volume Control**: Playback volume is controlled via `AVAudioPlayerNode.volume`
4. **Mixing**: Player output is mixed with live input at `AVAudioEngine.mainMixerNode`

## Core Workflow State Machine

### Transport States

```
┌─────────┐  Record   ┌───────────┐  Stop Recording  ┌─────────┐
│ STOPPED │ ────────→ │ RECORDING │ ──────────────→ │ STOPPED │
│         │           │           │                  │ (w/Audio)│

     └──────────────│ PLAYING │ ←─────────────────────── │ STOPPED │
                     │         │                          │ (w/Audio)│
                     └─────────┘                          └─────────┘
```

### State Transitions

1. **STOPPED → RECORDING**
   - User presses record button
   - Creates new `SimpleRecorder` instance
   - Installs audio tap on input node
   - Creates new WAV file with input format
   - Begins writing audio buffers to file

2. **RECORDING → STOPPED (with audio)**
   - User presses record button again (stop & play behavior)
   - Removes audio tap from input node
   - Closes audio file (automatic via nil assignment)
   - Updates state to indicate audio is available
   - Automatically transitions to playback

3. **STOPPED → PLAYING**
   - User presses play button (requires existing audio)
   - Creates new `SimplePlayer` instance
   - Loads recorded audio file
   - Schedules looped playback
   - Starts playback with volume control

4. **PLAYING → STOPPED**
   - User presses stop or play button (toggle behavior)
   - Stops `AVAudioPlayerNode`
   - Maintains audio file reference for future playback

## Error Handling Strategy

### Audio Engine Errors
- Engine startup failures are logged and could show user alerts
- Configuration changes are monitored and logged
- Recording format mismatches are prevented via dynamic format detection

### File System Errors
- Recording file creation errors are caught and propagated
- Playback file loading errors are handled gracefully
- Missing file scenarios are prevented via state validation

### Device Change Handling
- Audio device changes are automatically detected
- Current operations are not interrupted unless necessary
- Next recording automatically uses new device format

## UI Integration Points

### Real-time Data Binding
- Input levels: `SimpleAudioEngine.inputLevel` → `SimpleLoopState.inputLevel` → UI meters
- Transport state: Direct binding to button enabled states
- Volume control: Bidirectional binding between UI slider and audio engine

### User Interaction Flow
1. **App Launch**: Audio engine starts, UI shows "Ready to Record"
2. **Record Press**: Immediately starts recording, UI shows "Recording..."
3. **Record Press Again**: Stops recording, automatically starts playback
4. **Play/Stop**: Toggle playback of recorded loop
5. **Clear**: Removes audio file and resets to initial state

## Threading Model

### Main Thread Operations
- UI updates and state changes
- User interaction handling
- Audio engine control commands

### Audio Thread Operations
- Real-time audio buffer processing
- File I/O during recording
- Level calculation and monitoring

### Thread Safety

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a real-time audio looping application with professional-grade audio handling and a clean, maintainable codebase.

## NEW FEATURE: Input Monitoring Toggle

### Overview
The input monitoring toggle feature allows users to control whether they hear live input audio through speakers/headphones while maintaining full recording capability. This feature was implemented according to the detailed specifications in the feature request.

### Implementation Summary

#### 1. Model Changes (`SimpleLoopState.swift`)
```swift
@Published var inputMonitoringEnabled: Bool = true
```
- Added new state property for monitoring control
- Defaults to `true` (monitoring enabled) as specified
- Does not persist between app sessions (always starts with monitoring ON)

#### 2. Audio Engine Changes (`SimpleAudioEngine.swift`)
```swift
private let monitoringMixerNode: AVAudioMixerNode
```

**Signal Path Implementation:**
```
inputNode → monitoringMixerNode → mainMixerNode (for monitoring)
inputNode → audioTap (for recording & levels - unaffected by monitoring)
```

**Key Methods:**
```swift
func setInputMonitoring(enabled: Bool) {
    monitoringMixerNode.outputVolume = enabled ? 1.0 : 0.0
}
```

#### 3. ViewModel Changes (`SimpleLooperViewModel.swift`)
```swift
func toggleInputMonitoring() {
    loopState.inputMonitoringEnabled.toggle()
    audioEngine.setInputMonitoring(enabled: loopState.inputMonitoringEnabled)
}
```

#### 4. UI Changes (`LevelMeterView.swift` & `ContentView.swift`)
- Created `InputMonitoringView` combining level meter and monitoring toggle
- Created custom `CheckboxToggleStyle` for clean checkbox appearance
- Replaced standalone `LevelMeterView` with combined `InputMonitoringView`

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Audio Signal Architecture
The implementation uses a dedicated monitoring mixer node to control input monitoring without affecting recording:

1. **Input Node**: Captures audio from microphone/input device
2. **Monitoring Mixer Node**: Controls volume for monitoring path only
3. **Main Mixer Node**: Receives monitoring audio and playback audio
4. **Audio Tap**: Directly from input node for recording and level monitoring

#### Benefits of This Architecture
- **Clean Separation**: Recording and monitoring are independent
- **No Recording Impact**: Monitoring state doesn't affect recording quality
- **Continuous Levels**: Input level meter works regardless of monitoring state
- **Low Latency**: Minimal additional processing overhead
- **Thread Safe**: Volume changes are thread-safe in AVFoundation

#### State Management
- **Default State**: Monitoring enabled (`true`) on app launch
- **No Persistence**: State resets to enabled when app restarts
- **UI Binding**: Two-way binding between UI checkbox and state
- **Audio Sync**: Audio engine state updated immediately when UI changes

### Testing Validation
